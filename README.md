## Installation

> Requires [PHP 8.0.0+](https://php.net/releases)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require felixdorn/tin
```

## ðŸ”ž Screenshots

Yes, this comes from a terminal.

## Usage

```php
<?php

use Felix\Tin\Themes\JetbrainsDark;
use Felix\Tin\Tin;

$theme = new JetbrainsDark();
$tin = new Tin($theme);

echo $tin->process("<?php\n\necho 'Hello world';\n", ansi: true);
```

You can disable the ansi output by passing `false` as the second parameter.

## Themes

* [`Felix\Tin\Themes\JetbrainsDark`](src/Themes/JetbrainsDark.php)
* [`Felix\Tin\Themes\OneDark`](src/Themes/OneDark.php)

### Creating a theme

You need to extend `Felix\Tin\Themes\Theme` and set the colors to whatever you want.

The color are RGB values separated by a `;`.

```php
use Felix\Tin\Themes\Theme;

class OneDark extends Theme
{
    public string $keyword        = '199;120;221';
    public string $variable       = '224;107;116';
    public string $comment        = '91;98;110';
    public string $default        = '171;178;191';
    public string $string         = '152;195;121';
    public string $function       = '98;174;239';
    public string $number         = '229;192;122';
    public string $attribute      = '98;174;239';
    public string $namedParameter = '98;174;239';
}
```

## Performance

The code has been optimized a lot as i needed to highlight files quickly. Therefore, some compromise were made in terms
of code readability and simplicity.

It takes on average 0.0007 second per file.

To put that in context, highlighting the whole PHPUnit library takes ~265ms.

Highlighting the vendor directory of this package takes ~1.78s. That's 1320 files per seconds.

> PHP built-in tokenizer for PHP uses most of the memory (around 80-90%)

## Future

* PHPDoc
* Various outputs (cli / web)
* Line prefixes aka support for line numbers
* grayscale theme

## Known Issues

Named parameters are simply ignored by the built-in PHP parse which means that if you're named parameter is also a
keyword such as for, default. The highlighter wont pick up on it and will highlight it as a keyword rather than a named
parameter.

There is no solution to that problem unless we implement our own parser (no) or the parser gets fixed,

## Testing

```bash
composer test
