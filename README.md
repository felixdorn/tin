## Installation

> Requires [PHP 8.0.0+](https://php.net/releases)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require felixdorn/tin
```

## Usage


## Performance

The code has been optimized a lot as I needed to highlight thousands of files quickly with a low-memory usage.

It takes on average 0.0007 second per file.

To put that in context, highlighting the whole PHPUnit library takes ~265ms and around 3mb of memory. The memory
overhead of the highlighting is small as just tokenizing takes 2.8mb of memory.

Highlighting the vendor directory of this package takes ~1.78s. That's 1320 files per seconds for ~13mb of memory (as we
load these files in memory).
